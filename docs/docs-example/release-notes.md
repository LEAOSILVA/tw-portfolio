**New feature**

- **Release creation and management**  

  The integration deployment process now requires creating a release, which represents a specific version of your integration flow.  
  With this feature, you can control and manage different versions of your integrations, ensuring greater organization and traceability in deployments.  

  Check out [how to create releases](https://docs.sensedia.com/en/integrations-guide/Latest/flow-deploy.html).

**Fix**

* **Deployment error in flows with the EIP PollEnrich** 

  We fixed an error that occurred when using the EIP **PollEnrich**.  
  When trying to create an endpoint from the URI, Camel could not find the responsible component, and the error was raised after deployment, when executing the flow.

  <summary>August 05, 2025</summary>

**Fix**

- **REST connector logging issue in diagram-type flows** 

    We fixed an error that occurred when using **REST connectors**, in which the request responses were sent to Analytics without the attributes that link the log message to the specific `runtimeExecutionId`. This caused difficulties to visualize errors in the executions.
